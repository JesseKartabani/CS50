sort1 uses: TODO

Selection Sort

How do you know?: TODO

By using the command time ./sort1 random50000.txt I was able to get the run time of sort1 in real time (0m15.446s)
then I compared that against the other two sorting alogrithms. Knowing selection sort is the slowest algorithm of
the three (selection sort, bubble sort, merge sort) I was able to come to the conclusion that sort1 uses selection
sort.

sort2 uses: TODO

Merge Sort

How do you know?: TODO

By using the command time ./sort2 random50000.txt I was able to get the run time of sort2 in real time (0m3.952s)
then I compared that against the other two sorting alogrithms. Knowing merge sort is the fastest algorithm of
the three (selection sort, bubble sort, merge sort) I was able to come to the conclusion that sort2 uses merge
sort.

sort3 uses: TODO

Bubble Sort

How do you know?: TODO

By using the command time ./sort3 random50000.txt I was able to get the run time of sort3 in real time (0m9.311s)
then I compared that against the other two sorting alogrithms. Knowing bubble sort is the 2nd fastest algorithm of
the three (selection sort, bubble sort, merge sort) I was able to come to the conclusion that sort3 uses bubble
sort.
